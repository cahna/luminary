Luminary
========

_Luminary_: A visual debugging toolbar for Lapis websites written in Moonscript (also, the program used in the Lunar Module on Apollo's Guidance Computer).
 
Inspired by CakePHP's debugkit, Django's debug toolbar, and others.

This project is meant to extend @leafo's work developing [Lapis](https://github.com/leafo/lapis) and [Lapis-console](https://github.com/leafo/lapis-console), and to make Lapis & Moonscript more inviting and accessible to a wide range of developers. Lapis-console has been forked, bashed around, and included within this module.

## Goals ##

 1. Provide an intuitive, clean, debug module for moonscript applications. Make something you'd _want_ to use on every Lapis project.
 2. Require minimal configuration: 
    - require module once (or less, ie: enable via lapis config?)
    - add within view once (or less?)
    - allow for further extension with custom panels (maybe later)
    - Don't be intrusive or behave unexpectedly
 3. Complete goals list
